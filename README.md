## Introduction
This repository contains a sample integration of Fizz into Unity3d. The sample implements a basic multi-linugal chat system with profanity filtering.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the 'Sample' scene under the 'Scenes' directory.
3. Hit run.
4. Select a user from the user dropdown.
5. Select a language from the language dropdown.
6. Click Connect (when connected the message input field will be enabled and the last 5 messages in the channel will be added to the mesage log).
7. Type any text in the message input field and hit enter.

## Requirements
The Fizz client requires the .NET 4.x runtime to run. Therefore the sample is not compatible with Unity versions that do not support this new runtime.

## Supported Platforms
* Mac OS X
* Windows
* Android
* iOS
